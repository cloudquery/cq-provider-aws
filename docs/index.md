## AWS Provider

The CloudQuery AWS provider pulls configuration out of AWS resources, normalizes them and stores them in PostgreSQL database.

### Install

```shell
cloudquery init aws
```

### Authentication

To authenticate cloudquery with your AWS account you can use any of the following options (see full documentation at [AWS SDK V2](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)):

- Static Credentials: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- Shared configuration files (via `aws configure`).
  - SDK defaults to `credentials` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer.
  - SDK defaults to `config` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer.
- If your application uses an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM role for tasks.
- If your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, IAM role for Amazon EC2.

### Configuration

The following configuration section can be automaticlly generated by `cloudquery init aws`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  configuration {
    // Optional. if you want to assume role to multiple account and fetch data from them
    //accounts "<YOUR ID>" {
    // Optional. Role ARN we want to assume when accessing this account
    // role_arn = <YOUR_ROLE_ARN>
    // }
    // Optional. by default assumes all regions
    // regions = ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    // Optional. Enable AWS SDK debug logging.
    aws_debug = false
    // The maximum number of times that a request will be retried for failures. Defaults to 5 retry attempts.
    // max_retries = 5
    // The maximum back off delay between attempts. The backoff delays exponentially with a jitter based on the number of attempts. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    // max_backoff = 30
  }
```

By default cloudquery will fetch all configuration from **all** resources in **all** regions in the **default** account. You can change this behaviour with the following arguments:

- `accounts` **(Optional)** - Specify multiple accounts to fetch data from them concurrently and then query across accounts. The default configured account should be able [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) to the specified accounts.
- `regions` **(Optional)** - limit fetching to specific regions.

### Query Examples

#### Find all public facing load balancers

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_elbv2_load_balancers WHERE scheme = 'internet-facing';
```

#### Find all unencrypted RDS instances

```sql
SELECT * from aws_rds_clusters where storage_encrypted = 0;
```

#### Find all unencrypted buckets

```sql
SELECT * from aws_rds_clusters where storage_encrypted = 0;
```
