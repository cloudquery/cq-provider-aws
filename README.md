CloudQuery AWS Provider ![BuildStatus](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/cloudquery/cq-provider-aws/test?style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cloudquery/cloudquery?style=flat-square)
==================================

This [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery)
provider transforms AWS resources to relational database.

## What is CloudQuery

CloudQuery extracts, transform and load your cloud infrastructure and SaaS apps configuration to SQL database.
This abstracts various scattered APIs enabling you to define security, compliance, governance  and cost policies with SQL.

CloudQuery can be easily extended to more resources and SaaS providers (open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/issues)).

Think about CloudQuery as a compliance-as-code tool inspired by tools like [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), cool right?
